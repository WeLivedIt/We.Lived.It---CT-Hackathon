### Description

Inclusivity both empowers individuals and benefits organisations because diversity is key to innovation (https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance). 

Our project works to create more inclusive online and decentralised workplaces, in order to attract diverse talent and foster innovative collaborations. We are building an AI assistant which can scan text to identify toxic speech. Toxic speech is rife in online spaces and even more so if you are from one or more marginalised communities. By incorporating an AI assistant like this into a DAO, you are taking steps to creating an inclusive organisational culture by building in anti-hate mechanisms from the outset. Not having these mechanisms in place is what often leads to a lack of representation in organisations. 

1. Community governed finetuning

   As community users experience toxicity online, they can choose to submit these examples to finetune the LLM. Thus improving it's ability to moderate using real-world examples of toxic/hate speech data. To do so, they must add context to the data and put it up for a vote to the community. If the community agree that this should be added to the queue for finetuning the model, then the data will be submitted and the model fine-tuned accordingly.

3. Dashboard

   Once a community has engaged in finetuning an LLM to reflect the values of their community, they can record this on-chain to our 'Organisational Dashboard'. Other online communities can then access a pre-trained model to moderate their own communities online spaces. For example, RnDAO can train their model to maintain a Discord server with the community values that moderate their online space against toxicity with respect to 'age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership (in employment only), pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation'. If another DAO wants to moderate their online community to uphold these same values, they can now use the model which has already been finetuned by RnDAO.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
